title: "Buyable Items and Shop Pricing Mechanics"
---

## Overview
Buying trips allow your minion to purchase large quantities of certain items over time.
Most buyables are purchased instantly for a flat GP price. Others simulate shop
mechanics where prices rise as stock is bought and the minion must world hop.

## Instant Buyables
Items without `shopQuantity` or `changePer` simply cost their listed `gpCost`.
The GP is removed from your bank and the items are delivered immediately, like a
virtual Grand Exchange.

## Shop Buyables
Some items come from in game shops and follow Old School RuneScape pricing rules:

- **gpCost** – base price (100%).
- **changePer** – price increase per item bought (e.g. `1` for +1%).
- **shopQuantity** – items available before world hopping.

Price increases linearly within a world and resets after each hop.

Example: Arrow shafts start at 1 GP each and increase by 1% per shaft. After
buying 1000 the average price is around 5.5 GP before hopping.

```ts
price = Math.floor(basePrice * (1 + changePer / 100 * itemsBoughtInWorld))
```

Every `shopQuantity` items the minion hops to a new world and pricing starts over.

### Fields Used in Code
- `gpCost: number`
- `shopQuantity?: number`
- `changePer?: number`
- `quantityPerHour: number` – limits trip length

### Current Shop-Based Buyables
Arrow shafts, Blood runes, Law runes, Soul runes, Astral runes, Death runes,
Nature runes and Chaos runes.

Most items remain simple flat-cost purchases but these shop buyables use the
`calculateShopBuyCost` function to determine total and average price while
world hopping.
