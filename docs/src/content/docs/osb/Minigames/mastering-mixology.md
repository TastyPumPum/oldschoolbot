title: "Mastering Mixology"
---

Mastering Mixology is a minigame unlocked after completing the **Children of the Sun** quest and requires **60 Herblore**.

## Creating Paste

Use [[/minigames mastering_mixology create herb\:<herb> quantity\:<quantity>]] to turn herbs into paste. Each herb yields a specific amount of paste.

## Starting Contracts

Once you have paste, start contracts with [[/minigames mastering_mixology start]] and optionally specify the number of contracts. Your minion will attempt random contracts using your available paste.

## Rewards

Completing contracts grants Herblore XP and Mixology points which can be spent on rewards in the future. Each paste used in a contract normally gives **10** points of that paste type. Contracts that use three of the same paste only give **2/3** of the usual points, while contracts that use all three different pastes grant **double** points.

Example point rewards:

- **Alco-AugmentAtor** – awards 20 Aga points.
- **Azure Aura Mix** – awards 20 Aga points and 10 Mox points.
- **MixALot** – awards 20 points of each paste.
