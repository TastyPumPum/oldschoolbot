title: "Woodcutting"
---

You can train Woodcutting using [[/chop name\:Logs]]. If no quantity is specified, it will default to a full trip. Using the powerchop option will result in no logs being obtained, but provides significantly faster woodcutting xp rates.

- [[/chop name\:Willow logs quantity\:50]]
- [[/chop name\:Teak logs powerchop\:true]]

## Axes

All axes in the bot will provide a specific increase to your chance of chopping logs (i.e. chopping speed). The best axe to use is a Crystal axe (Lvl 71) with the second-best being a Dragon, Infernal, or 3rd Age axe (Lvl 61). Gilded axes perform the same as a rune axe. The Crystal axe does not degrade and the Infernal axe does not burn logs while chopping. Axes do not need to be equipped for the bonus to apply.

## Woodcutting Guild

If you have at least 60 Woodcutting, and the tree you are attempting to chop is located within the Woodcutting guild, you will gain an invisible +7 wc levels. This will grant a small increase to the speed in which you will chop logs.

- **Trees in Guild** - Normal, Oak, Willow, Maple, Yew, Magic, Redwood

## Powerchopping

Using this filter when chopping logs allows your minion to reach much higher xp rates, at the expense of not receiving any logs from your trip. For ironmen, it may be beneficial to chop normally so they can use the logs for early firemaking or construction levels. You will still receive bird nests and their contents when powerchopping.

After level 92, your minion magically learns how to tick manipulate, allowing rates of up to 200k xp/h powerchopping Teak logs.
To use the 1.5 tick method you must chop the trees planted in Farming patches. Teak trees require [[woodcutting:92]] and [[farming:35]], while Mahogany trees require [[woodcutting:92]] and [[farming:55]]. Forestry events must be disabled for this method.

## Lumberjack Outfit

The Lumberjack outfit can be obtained from the [Temple Trekking](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/temple-trekking) minigame. When equipped in the skilling setup, it provides the following boosts to woodcutting XP:

- 0.4% - Lumberjack hat
- 0.8% - Lumberjack top
- 0.6% - Lumberjack legs
- 0.2% - Lumberjack boots
- 2.5% - Full outfit equipped in skilling setup

## Logs

This table assumes no powerchopping is active.
