# Patron soundtrack audio assets

The ambience clips used for the patron mini soundtrack feature are not committed to the repository to avoid bundling binary assets.

Add your own short OGG/Opus files in this directory with the following filenames so the feature can play them:

- `tavern.ogg`
- `dungeon.ogg`
- `forest.ogg`
- `sea.ogg`

Clips should be roughly 5 seconds long and pre-encoded for Discord voice playback. If the files are missing, the bot will skip playback automatically.
